## General
There is no course text, but this one:
+ Brunsdon C and L Comber. 2018. [*An Introduction to R for Spatial Analysis and Mapping*](https://au.sagepub.com/en-gb/oce/an-introduction-to-r-for-spatial-analysis-and-mapping/book241031 "Brunsdon and Comber Introduction to R book") 2nd edn. Sage, London.

is likely to be useful for anyone who wants to extend their *R* knowledge. Also very useful (and freely available online) is
