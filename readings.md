## General
There is no course text, but this one:
+ Brunsdon C and L Comber. 2018. [*An Introduction to R for Spatial Analysis and Mapping*](https://au.sagepub.com/en-gb/oce/an-introduction-to-r-for-spatial-analysis-and-mapping/book241031 "Brunsdon and Comber Introduction to R book") 2nd edn. Sage, London.

is likely to be useful for anyone who wants to extend their *R* knowledge. Also very useful (and freely available online) is
+ Lovelace R, J Nowosad and J Münchow. 2019. [*Geocomputation with R*](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/ "Lovelace et al. Geocomputation with R book"). Boca Raton: Taylor & Francis

## Week 1 General background

  Brunsdon C and A Comber. 2020. [Opening practice: supporting reproducibility and critical spatial data science](http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10109-020-00334-2). *Journal of Geographical Systems*.

  give a sense of the current state of GIS in relation to broader trends in open data science

+ [R spatial resources](https://www.r-spatial.org/projects/ "R spatial stuff")

## Week 2 Data
+ Online material for [_Data Feminism_](https://mitpressonpubpub.mitpress.mit.edu/data-feminism "Data feminism stuff")
+ Podcast with  the [authors discussing data feminism](https://newbooksnetwork.com/catherine-dignazio-and-lauren-klein-data-feminism-mit-press-2020/ "data feminism on the new books network podcast")
+ Hadley Wickham's article on ['Tidy data'](https://dx.doi.org/10.18637/jss.v059.i10)

## Week 3
### The grammar of graphics
Hadley Wickham's article about a [layered grammar of graphics](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf)

### Some resources on choropleth maps
Here are some reasonably useful resources on choropleth mapping
+ [What to consider when creating choropleth maps](https://blog.datawrapper.de/choroplethmaps/)
+ [Choropleth maps in `tmap`](https://michaelgastner.com/DAVisR2021/choropleth-world-maps-and-the-tmap-package.html)

### Data measurement scales
+ Stevens' 1946 [article on scales of measurement](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1675368 "On the theory of scales of measurement") (nominal, ordinal, interval etc.)
+ Velleman and Wilkinson's 1993 article suggesting that [the typology is limiting and misleading](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2684788 "Nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio typologies are misleading")
+ Nick Chrisman's 1998 article [relating all this to geographical data](https://dx.doi.org/10.1559/152304098782383043 "Rethinking Levels of Measurement for Cartography")

### Colour
+ The [ColorBrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org) website is a nice way to get familiar with different colour palettes
+ This [colour blindness simulator]
(https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/) is really useful for getting an idea of how your maps will look with various kinds of colour blindness

#### Colour science
+ This [video about the viridis colour palette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAoljeRJ3lU) project is a great primer about how incredibly complicated colour is
+ and if you think that's complicated, [look at what happens when you take colour blindness seriously](https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0199239) (which you should)
