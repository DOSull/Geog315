# Readings
## General
There is no course text, but this one:

  + Brunsdon C and L Comber. 2018. [*An Introduction to R for Spatial Analysis and Mapping*](https://au.sagepub.com/en-gb/oce/an-introduction-to-r-for-spatial-analysis-and-mapping/book258267 "Brunsdon and Comber Introduction to R book") 2nd edn. Sage, London.

might be useful for anyone who wants to extend their *R* knowledge. Also very useful (and freely available online) is

  + Lovelace R, J Nowosad and J Münchow. 2019. [*Geocomputation with R*](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/ "Lovelace et al. Geocomputation with R book"). Boca Raton: Taylor & Francis

### Table joins
+ [This page](https://statisticsglobe.com/r-dplyr-join-inner-left-right-full-semi-anti "Summary of the dplyr join operations") provides a nice quick summary of how the various`dplyr`  `*_join` operations work, with a very simple example dataset
+ [Details of the table join operations](https://rstudio-education.github.io/tidyverse-cookbook/transform-tables.html#joins "Joins in the tidyverse cookbook") in the tidyverse cookbook

### Spatial operations
+ [A more complete (and technical) discussion of the `sf` geometry operations](https://r-spatial.org/book/07-Introsf.html#sec-sfintro) available in online form, from the book
  + Pebesma EJ and R Bivand. 2023. _Spatial Data Science: With Applications in R_. Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press.
+ [A more 'GIS-y' take on spatial joins](https://gisgeography.com/spatial-join/)

## Week 5
### Visualizing clustering
It is well worth playing with these clustering visualizations:
+ [K-means](https://www.naftaliharris.com/blog/visualizing-k-means-clustering)
+ [DBscan](https://www.naftaliharris.com/blog/visualizing-dbscan-clustering/)

The important thing to keep in mind is that the space in which the points are displayed is not a map, it's a 'data-space', and also, that it is not two-dimensional, it is as-many-dimensional as there are attributes in your dataset (which might be a lot).

### LENZ
The [LENZ project](https://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/tools-and-resources/mapping/lenz/) data are available to download from [here](https://lris.scinfo.org.nz/data/?q=lenz "LENZ project data"). If you are really interested in the technical details, you can find it all [here](https://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/uploads/public/Tools-And-Resources/Maps/LENZ/LENZ_Technical_Guide.pdf "LENZ Technical Guide").

### Geodemographics
On the history from the perspective of two enthusiasts:

+ Spielman SE and A Singleton. 2015. [Studying Neighborhoods Using Uncertain Data from the American Community Survey: A Contextual Approach](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00045608.2015.1052335). *Annals of the Association of American Geographers* **105**(5) 1003–1025.

And a critical perspective from an innocent time when geodemographics seemed like the most appalling invasion of privacy imaginable:

+ Goss, J. 1995. ["We Know Who You Are and We Know Where You Live": The Instrumental Rationality of Geodemographic Systems](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/144357). *Economic Geography* **71**(2) 171–198.

(things have got a lot worse since those innocent days)

### Monopoly
Not exactly relevant, but the history of the boardgame Monopoly is pretty wild, if you haven't heard it. This [99% Invisible podcast episode](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-landlords-game/) and [this Anthropocene Reviewed one](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/anthropocene-reviewed/episodes/anthropocene-reviewed-monopoly-academic-decathlon) both have nice overviews (they're also generally great podcasts...). 

If reading is more your speed, then the blow-by-blow is here and I highly recommend it (although I am afraid the library does not have a copy):

+ Pilon M. 2015. [_The Monopolists: Obsession, Fury, and the Scandal Behind the World’s Favorite Board Game_](https://www.marypilon.com/monopoly). New York: Bloomsbury.
