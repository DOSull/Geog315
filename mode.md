This class is offered face-to-face for both lectures and labs. Lectures will be recorded and available on Blackboard soon after.

Software required to complete lab sessions is free to download and install so that you can complete labs while working remotely. Details of getting set up for this will be available in the first week of semester.

Supplemental video tutorial material will be provided to assist students in completion of labs remotely.

In addition a course Slack channel (link to follow) provides rapid responses to technical questions about lab materials (please use it, and also answer other's questions if you can!).

If you have particular difficulties with labs and are working remotely then appointments to meet by zoom can be made from [this link](https://calendly.com/dosullivan).
