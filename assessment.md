### Late submission penalties
All assignments must be handed in by their due dates. Non-submission  by the required date will result in a 5% penalty  off your grade for that assignment for each day or part thereof that the coursework is late.  No submissions will be accepted more than 5 days after the due date.

Computer crash or similar excuses are not acceptable. Save your material and make sure you have something to submit by the due date.
