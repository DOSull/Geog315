Lab sessions follow the lecture sessions and will cover practical topics related to the lecture materials.

Only four sessions have an associated assessed assignment, but you should attend all labs and participate fully to broaden your knowledge of GIScience methods and tools as any of the approaches covered may prove useful for you in other parts of this course and your studies more generally.

## Links to each lab (when available)
+ **Week 1** [Setting up your computer](labs/week-01)
+ **Week 2** [Introduction to *R* and *RStudio*](labs/week-02)
+ **Week 3** [Making maps](labs/week-03)
+ **Week 4** Spatial data wrangling
+ **Week 5** Geographic cluster analysis
+ **Week 7** Regression analysis in *R*
+ **Week 9** [The mini-projects](labs/mini-project)

### Non-assessed lab work
Note that there are also non-assessed lab sessions. In particular lab sessions in the second half of trimester (and some lecture sessions too) are intended to provide an environment in which it is easy to get assistance and advice from the course instructors. You are strongly advised to make the most of these sessions!

## Mini-projects
The final assessment in the class is a mini-project, which is a more open-ended and slightly more substantial exercise in data analysis and presentation. Lab _and_ lecture time in the last 3 weeks or so of semester will be allocated to supporting you in this exercise.

An assortment of datasets will be provided, from which you choose one to work on. The data will need some tidying and sorting to be suitable for use, and you will be expected to figure out the analysis workflow yourself, in order to pursue a particular angle of inquiry.

Datasets are still being assembled, but will cover a range of topics including:

+ Wellington house prices
+ Police involved shootings in the US
+ Landslides in Aotearoa New Zealand
+ Distribution of _tradescantia_ in Aotearoa New Zealand
+ COVID cases in Hong Kong

So hopefully you'll be able to find something of interest. If you have a dataset from some other class or an idea for a topic not in the list of available topics, then please be in touch and we can discuss possibilities.

## Course Slack channel
A link to join the course slack channel will be sent via Blackboard. This should be used for technical support questions on the labs.
