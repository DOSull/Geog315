# Labs & project
Lab sessions are sequenced to run in parallel with the lecture materials and will cover practical topics related to them.

Only four lab sessions have an associated assessed assignment, but you should attend all labs and participate fully to broaden your knowledge of geospatial data science methods and tools as any of the approaches covered may prove useful for you in the project component of the class or in your geographical studies more generally.

## Links to lab materials
You can get an idea of what's coming from the links below.

**HOWEVER**, materials _are not current for 2022 until the pages are marked with the heading **Geog 315 T1 2022**_ (and not an earlier year). You are advised not to work on any lab materials until the heading is updated (since the assessment items may change) to 2022. You can still get an idea of what to expect in most cases, before then.

### Non-assessed lab work
Note that there are also non-assessed lab sessions. In particular lab sessions in the second half of trimester (and some lecture sessions too) are intended to provide an environment in which it is easy to get assistance and advice from the course instructor. You are strongly advised to make the most of these sessions!

## Mini-projects
The final assessment in the class is a mini-project, which is a more open-ended and more substantial exercise in data analysis and presentation. Lab _and_ lecture time in the last 3 weeks or so of semester will be allocated to supporting you in this exercise.

An assortment of datasets will be provided, from which you choose one to work on. The data will need some tidying and sorting to be suitable for use, and you will be expected to figure out the analysis workflow yourself, in order to pursue a particular angle of inquiry.

A number of datasets are available covering a range of topics, so hopefully you'll be able to find something of interest. If you have a dataset from some other class or an idea for a topic not in the list of available topics, then please be in touch and we can discuss possibilities.

Expectations for the submitted report from the mini-project are [provided here](labs/mini-project/guidance-on-mini-project-report.md "guidance on the mini-project report write-up").

## Course Slack channel
A link to join the [course slack channel](https://vuwgeog315t12022.slack.com/ "Course slack channel") will be sent via Blackboard. This should be used for technical support questions on the labs.
