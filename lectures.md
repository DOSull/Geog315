# Lectures & readings
## Lectures
Lectures will consist of 40 minutes or so of presented material with time for more open-ended discussion and Q&A based on any reading or other materials students have been asked to explore ahead of class.

The lecture schedule for the second half of trimester is *not set in stone*. Topics to be covered will be determined based on class and project group needs and preferences, and I will also aim to secure two or even three guest lectures, from industry and government practitioners.

### Readings
Details of any required readings will be provided ahead of class and where possible either publicly available, or linked from [Blackboard](https://blackboard.vuw.ac.nz/).
