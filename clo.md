# Course learning objectives
#### 1. Appreciate and describe the scope, limitations and challenges of geospatial methods in real world applications;
#### 2. Record, enter, manipulate and analyse geographic data;
#### 3. Critically assess and communicate geospatial information and the outcome ofgeospatial projects in terms of relevancy to project aims and against more general constraints, e.g. ethical and time constraints;
#### 4. Understand the complexity of data issues concerning the acquisition, creation, quality assurance, management and appropriate analysis and visualisation of spatial and attribute data;
#### 5. Communicate geospatial knowledge effectively;
#### 6. Demonstrate an understanding of spatial information by identifying and applying appropriate geospatial techniques to the solution of a practical project; and
#### 7. The course has three primary aims:
+ To give you a more detailed and critical understanding of geospatial methods and how they are used;
+ To expand your knowledge of geospatial software through guided practicals and a project undertaken in geospatial tools of your choice and through data cleaning and preparation; and
+ To enrich your written and verbal communication skills which are vital in any use of geospatial methods.
