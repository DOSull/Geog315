## Geog 315 Advanced Geographic Information Systems
This course looks at the more advanced aspects of geographic information systems (GIS). There is a particular emphasis on open source tools and on approaches to doing geospatial analysis in code using *R* as these are becoming increasingly important in science and other workplace settings. The major assessment component of the class is a mini-project exercise which gives students an opportunity to explore methods and topics of interest to themselves, and also to develop confidence exploring and present results from the analysis of spatial data using a modern literate programming approach.

It is expected that students will have completed [GEOG 215](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/courses/geog/215/2020/offering?crn=25033), [GEOG 415](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/courses/geog/415/2020/offering?crn=25033) or an introductory course in GIS at another institution.

Detailed information about course delivery, logistics, schedule, assessment, etc., is linked from the headers at the top of this page.

### Course learning objectives
#### 1. Appreciate and describe the scope, limitations and challenges of geospatial methods in real world applications;
#### 2. Record, enter, manipulate and analyse geographic data;
#### 3. Critically assess and communicate geospatial information and the outcome ofgeospatial projects in terms of relevancy to project aims and against more general constraints, e.g. ethical and time constraints;
#### 4. Understand the complexity of data issues concerning the acquisition, creation, quality assurance, management and appropriate analysis and visualisation of spatial and attribute data;
#### 5. Communicate geospatial knowledge effectively;
#### 6. Demonstrate an understanding of spatial information by identifying and applying appropriate geospatial techniques to the solution of a practical project; and
#### 7. The course has three primary aims:
+ To give you a more detailed and critical understanding of geospatial methods and how they are used;
+ To expand your knowledge of geospatial software through guided practicals and a project undertaken in geospatial tools of your choice and through data cleaning and preparation; and
+ To enrich your written and verbal communication skills which are vital in any use of geospatial methods.
