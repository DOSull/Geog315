## Geog 315 Advanced Geographic Information Systems
This course looks at the more advanced aspects of geographic information systems (GIS). There is a particular emphasis on open source tools and on approaches to doing geospatial analysis in code using *R* as these are becoming increasingly important in science and other workplace settings. The major assessment component of the class is a mini-project exercise which gives students an opportunity to explore methods and topics of interest to themselves, and also to develop confidence exploring and present results from the analysis of spatial data using a modern literate programming approach.

It is expected that students will have completed [GEOG 215](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/courses/geog/215/2021/offering?crn=25033), [GEOG 415](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/courses/geog/415/2021/offering?crn=25033) or an introductory course in GIS at another institution.
