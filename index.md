# Geog 315 Advanced Geographic Information Systems
This course looks at the more advanced aspects of geographic information systems (GIS). There is a particular emphasis on open source tools and on approaches to doing geospatial analysis in code using *R* as these are becoming increasingly important in science and other workplace settings. The major assessment component of the class is a mini-project exercise which gives students an opportunity to explore methods and topics of interest to themselves, and also to develop confidence exploring and present results from the analysis of spatial data using a modern literate programming approach.

It is expected that students will have completed [GEOG 215](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/courses/geog/215/2020/offering?crn=25033), [GEOG 415](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/courses/geog/415/2020/offering?crn=25033) or an introductory course in GIS at another institution.

## Course delivery in T2 2021
This class is offered face-to-face for both lectures and labs. If you are unable to attend face-to-face, lectures will be recorded and available on Blackboard soon after.

Software required to complete lab sessions is free to download and install so that you can complete labs while working remotely. Details of getting set up in this way will be available in the first week of semester.

Additionally supplemental video tutorial material will be provided to assist students in completion of labs remotely.

In addition a course Slack channel (link to follow) provides rapid responses to technical questions about lab materials (please use it, and also answer other's questions if you can!). If you have particular difficulties with labs and are working remotely then appointments to meet by zoom can be made from [this link](https://calendly.com/dosullivan).

If you cannot complete an assignment or sit a test or examination, refer to [Aegrotats](https://www.victoria.ac.nz/home/study/exams-and-assessments/aegrotat)
