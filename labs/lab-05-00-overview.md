# A simple (and probably flawed!) regression analysis in *R*
In this week's lab, I will walk you through building a dataset and running a regression analysis on it in *R*. 

To save you a lot of typing, this week we will use *R Markdown* files, that allow you to execute blocks of code without having to enter them at the console. We might run into a few glitches along the way, but I think that this will give you a real appreciation for some of the capabilities of this platform.

## Getting started
You need to download the data from [this zip file](lab-05.zip?raw=true) in the usual way, and uncompress and save it to a folder on the **H: drive**. 

Once you have done that, you will find a file called `lab-05-01-r-markdown-files.Rmd` in the folder. Use **File - Open File...** to open it in *RStudio*. 

Follow the instructions in that file to continue with this lab.
