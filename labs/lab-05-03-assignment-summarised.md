#### Geog 315 T2 2019 Week 5
# The assignment requirements summarised
Here are the questions from the lab all in one place for ease of reference. I haven't figure out how to provide links between Markdown files, so you'll have to find the questions in the `lab-05-02-main.Rmd` file.

### **Question 1**
#### Comment on the two distributions. Do they appear similar? Which of these two ways of visualising the relationship between Airbnb listings and the availability of amenities do you find the most informative? Explain your thinking. (**20%**) 

### **Question 2**
#### Based on this plot, which variables do you think are most likely to help account for the number of Airbnb listings in tracts? Explain your answer (keep in mind that negative associations between variables are also possible). (**15%**) 

### **Question 3**
#### Write a brief interpretation of this model describing in words what it seems to tell us about the effect of various neighbourhood factors on the numbers of Airbnb listings in the neighhbourhood. (**15%**)

### **Question 4**
Where does the model do particularly badly? Briefly speculate on what other factors not considered in this model might explain this. (Keep in mind that the amenity data is rather haphazard; what kind of 'amenities' does it miss?) (**20%**)

## Submission instructions
Prepare a PDF document that includes answers to the above questions. There are are a couple of maps requested, and the whole document should only need to be 2-3 pages (maximum). Submit the PDF file to [the dropbox provided on Blackboard here](https://blackboard.vuw.ac.nz/webapps/assignment/uploadAssignment?content_id=_2510956_1&course_id=_101127_1&group_id=&mode=cpview). The due date is 12:00PM (noon) on 6 September 2019. 

One option this week would be to make your answers as an `Rmd` file and then *knit* them to a Word document...
