# Clustering a spatial dataset
This week we will apply k-means clustering analysis to a spatial dataset, so you can see how the method might be used to segment a spatial dataset into various categories that make it easier to understand an otherwise complex situation.

The clustering method itself is demonstrated using a dataset for San Francisco, so you can see how the method is applied in practice, before introducing the dataset on which the assignment is based relating to Wellington commuter patterns, and the details of the assignment itself. So the pages of instructions this week are:

+ [Loading and exploring data](clustering-analysis-01-loading-and-exploring-data.md)
+ [Mapping k-means results](clustering-analysis-02-making-and-mapping-k-means-clusters.md)
+ [The assignment dataset](clustering-analysis-03-wellington-commuter-data.md)
+ [The assignment](clustering-analysis-04-assignment.md)

And the datasets are available here:

+ [San Francisco demonstration data](sf_demo.gpkg?raw=true)
+ [Wellington commuter data](welly-commutes.gpkg?raw=true)
