# Spatial data wrangling in *R*
Last week you (hopefully) got accustomed to basic map-making using the `sf` and `tmap`.

This week we focus more on typical kinds of data wrangling that are required *before* you can even think about making useful maps.

This time there are questions through the different sections so that you have a better idea when you should be paying close attention, and also so that it is easier to see where you can get credit for completing tasks and answering questions.

I have also made the ability to answer the questions less dependent on totally *getting* the details of the code.

You can look at the last page, to get an overview of the assignment requirements.

Again, the instructions this week are in several parts (previews of some pages are also linked below.)

+ [Introducing the data](spatial-data-manipulation-01-introducing-the-data.md)
+ [Dealing with map projections](spatial-data-manipulation-02-map-projections.md)
+ [Spatial joins, summarising data, and throwing away spatial information](spatial-data-manipulation-03-spatial-joins.md)
+ [The assignment summarised](spatial-data-manipulation-04-assignment.md)

There is an additional page of material on much more of the spatial data manipulation operations available in `sf` [here](spatial-data-manipulation-03B-spatial-relations.md), but this is not required to complete the assignment. It is covered in detail in class.

## Videos
There are three videos this week (I incorrectly say there are two near the start of the first one... FAKE NEWS)

+ [Spatial filtering the data](http://southosullivan.com/geog315/video/week-04-lab/geog315-week04-01-spatial-data-manipulation-data-prep.mp4) (6:38 min)
+ [Counting points in polygons with a spatial join](http://southosullivan.com/geog315/video/week-04-lab/geog315-week04-02-spatial-data-manipulation-st_join.mp4) (7:48 min)
+ [Counting points in polygons using a spatial predicate function](http://southosullivan.com/geog315/video/week-04-lab/geog315-week04-03-spatial-data-manipulation-st_contains.mp4) (7:20 min)
