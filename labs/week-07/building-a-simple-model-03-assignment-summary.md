# Assignment summary
Here are all the questions from the assignment in one location for convenience.

### **Question 1**
#### Based on making and exploring some maps, which variables in the `welly` base dataset, and which point locations in the `amenities` and `shops` datasets do you think are most likely to help account for the number of Airbnb listings across the region? There is no strictly correct answer to this question. The idea is to think about what you are doing before just making a statistical model without thinking!. (**20%**)

### **Question 2**
#### Write a brief interpretation of this model describing in words what it seems to tell us about the effect of different age group percentages on the numbers of Airbnb listings in neighbourhoods. (**20%**)

### **Question 3**
#### Where does the model do particularly badly? Briefly speculate on what other factors missing from this particular model (which uses only age data) might explain this. (**25%**)

### **Question 4**
#### For the model you made, include the code used to generate it and the output from the `summary` function. Also make a residuals map of your model. Briefly explain why you chose to build the model you did. What influenced your choice of variables to include? Explain what your model seems to show based on the results provided by the `summary` function. (**35%**)
