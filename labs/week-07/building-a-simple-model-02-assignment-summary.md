# Assignment summary
Here are all the questions from the assignment in one location for convenience.

### **Question 1**
#### Based on these maps, which variables do you think are most likely to help account for the number of Airbnb listings in tracts? Explain your answer (keep in mind that negative associations between variables are also possible). (**20%**)

### **Question 2**
#### Write a brief interpretation of this model describing in words what it seems to tell us about the effect of various neighbourhood factors on the numbers of Airbnb listings in neighhbourhoods. (**20%**)

### **Question 3**
#### Where does the model do particularly badly? Briefly speculate on what other factors missing from this model might explain this. (Keep in mind that the amenity data is rather haphazard; what kind of 'amenities' does it not include?) (**25%**)

### **Question 4**
#### For the model you made, include the code used to generate it and the output from the `summary` function. Also make a residuals map of your model. Briefly explain why you chose to build the model you did. What influenced your choice of variables to include? Explain what your model seems to show based on the results provided by the `summary` function. (**35%**)
