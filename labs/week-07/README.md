# Building a simple statistical model
This week the main focus of the assignment is building a simple statistical (regression) model to help us understand a spatial pattern.

We will also look at the _RMarkdown_ file format which you can use to present results from analysis in this or other assignments (this is not required, but can be a very powerful method for presenting analysis results).

Because the file format comes first and the lab material is presented in this format, we will consider that first, before going on to the assignment.

This means that the procedure this week is slightly different. You should download all the materials for this week's lab [from this link](geog315-t2-week-07-materials.zip?raw=true). You should then uncompress them to a folder on your computer and then open the contained `.Rmd` files in _RStudio_. From there you can read and run the instructions in _RStudio_ as set out in the files

+ `building-a-simple-model-01-rmarkdown.Rmd`, and
+ `building-a-simple-model-02-assignment.Rmd`

## Submission instructions
This week's assignment requirement is set out in the file `building-a-simple-model-02-main.Rmd`. You should prepare a document completing the analysis and answering the questions as set out in that document, and submit a short report to the dropbox provided on Blackboard by the end of the day on **21 September**.

You can prepare your report using _Rmarkdown_ and knitting the report (this is explained in this week's materials), or you can proceed in the more usual way preparing your report in _Word_ and including figures and tables as you usually would. Either is acceptable, but I would encourage you to at least experiment with knitting an _Rmarkdown_ file to understand the possibilities.

### PS
In case you are interested, the code and datasets used to make this week's assignment data can be found in [this folder](data-prep).
