# Installing ESRI software
There is no specific need for ESRI software in this class.

However as a registered VUW student you have access to a student licensed edition.

Instructions for installation have been provided to me by Mairéad De Roíste, and are posted on blackboard at [this link](https://blackboard.vuw.ac.nz/bbcswebdav/pid-3142119-dt-content-rid-14558552_1/xid-14558552_1).
