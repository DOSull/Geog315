# Installing _QGIS_
_QGIS_ is a fully functional and completely free alternative to _ArcGIS_. It's not required for this course (nor is _ArcGIS_), but it can be very useful and is unencumbered the complicated licensing of _Arc_, so you might find it a worthwhile thing to install.

This is straightforward to do, although figuring out exactly which version you want is not necessarily so obvious. All the links are here:
