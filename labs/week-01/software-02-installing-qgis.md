# Installing _QGIS_
_QGIS_ is a fully functional and completely free alternative to _ArcGIS_. It's not required for this course (nor is _ArcGIS_), but it can be very useful and is unencumbered by the complicated licensing of _Arc_, so you might find it a worthwhile thing to install.

This is straightforward to do, although figuring out exactly which version you want is not necessarily so obvious. All the links are here:

The specific downloads I recommend are

**Windows** [QGIS-OSGeo4W-3.22.3-1.msi](https://qgis.org/downloads/QGIS-OSGeo4W-3.22.3-1.msi)

**Mac** [qgis-macos-pr.dmg](https://qgis.org/downloads/macos/qgis-macos-pr.dmg)

**Linux** There are several flavours here and the links are clearly indicated on the downloads page.
