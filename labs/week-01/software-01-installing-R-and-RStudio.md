# Software setup for this course
Note that with recent changes in operating systems (the release of Windows 11) and new Apple hardware, it is difficult to provide directions for all users that are guaranteed to be right. If you are uncertain what you should do, get in touch on the [course slack](https://vuwgeog315t12022.slack.com "course slack workspace") and ask and we will do all we can to help.

The sooner you get set up the better, so please do this in the first week of trimester.

## Download and install _R_
### Windows and Mac
You'll find what you need at the [R project website](https://www.r-project.org/), but it's not exactly friendly, so to get you where you need a bit more quickly, here are the direct links for the Windows and Mac machine installers:

+ [Windows _R_ 4.1](https://cran.stat.auckland.ac.nz/bin/windows/base/R-4.1.2-win.exe) [right-click and save to download]
+ The Mac situation is complicated by recent changes in MacOS and the Mac ARM architecture which some may have on newer machines. Best bet is to find the version you need on [this page](https://cran.stat.auckland.ac.nz/bin/macosx/).

Click on the appropriate link to download the version for your operating system.

From there things should be fairly straightforward. Installing _R_ is no different than installing any other piece of software.

### Linux
If you are on Linux, I'll assume you know what you are doing when it comes to installing software. The key thing to know is that you need to find **version 4.1.2** of _R_. It's best not to install using your OS package management as you will end up with a relatively old version that way.

If you don't know what you are doing, then just ask for help!

## Download and install _RStudio_
### Windows and Mac
Once you have installed _R_ you can install _RStudio_. You'll find the download you need on [this page](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). I would recommend the 'installer' download for your operating system. For Windows and Mac these are

+ [Windows _RStudio_](https://download1.rstudio.org/desktop/windows/RStudio-2021.09.2-382.exe)
+ [Mac _RStudio_](https://download1.rstudio.org/desktop/macos/RStudio-2021.09.2-382.dmg)

Again from there it should be reasonably straightforward.

### Linux
Installers are at the same page linked above.

## Helpful videos
Since I am on Linux and not Windows or Mac, it doesn't make much sense for me to show you how to do this by recording a video on my machine. Helpful videos if you feel you need them are linked below. 'How to install R' videos are not exactly exciting, so I haven't watched these all the way through, but they seem helpful and up to date.
