## Download and install _R_
### Windows and Mac
You'll find what you need at the [R project website](https://www.r-project.org/), but it's not exactly friendly, so to get you where you need a bit more quickly, here are the direct links for the Windows and Mac machine installers:

+ [Windows _R_ 4.0](https://cran.stat.auckland.ac.nz/bin/windows/base/old/4.0.2/R-4.0.2-win.exe)
+ [Mac _R_ 4.0](https://cran.stat.auckland.ac.nz/bin/macosx/base/R-4.0.2.pkg)

Click on the appropriate link to download the version for your operating system.

From there things should be fairly straightforward. Installing _R_ is no different than installing any other piece of software.

### Linux
If you are on Linux, I'll assume you know what you are doing when it comes to installing software. The key thing to know is that you need to find **version 4.0.2** of _R_.

If you don't know what you are doing, then just ask for help!

## Download and install _RStudio_
### Windows and Mac
Once you have installed _R_ you can install _RStudio_. You'll find the download you need on [this page](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). I would recommend the 'installer' download for your operating system. For Windows and Mac these are

+ [Windows _RStudio_ 1.4](https://download1.rstudio.org/desktop/windows/RStudio-1.4.1717.exe)
+ [Mac _RStudio_ 1.4](https://download1.rstudio.org/desktop/macos/RStudio-1.4.1717.dmg)

Again from there it should be reasonably straightforward.

### Linux
Installers are at the same page linked above.

## Helpful videos
Since I am on Linux and not Windows or Mac, it doesn't make much sense for me to show you how to do this by recording a video on my machine. Helpful videos if you feel you need them are linked below. 'How to install R' videos are not exactly exciting, so I haven't watched these all the way through. If there's anything offensive on them, let me know and I'll remove these links (and you know... don't read the comments.)
