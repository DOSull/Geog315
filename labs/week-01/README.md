# Installing the course software
This class focuses on learning how to do 'geospatial stuff' in _R_ and _RStudio_, so an important task if you want to work on materials on your own computer is to install these pieces of software. These instructions help you through the process.

The steps involved are

+ [Download and install _R_ and _RStudio_](software-01-installing-R-and-RStudio.md)

followed optionally by

+ [Download and install _QGIS_](software-02-installing-qgis.md)
<!-- + [Download and install _ArcGIS_](software-03-installing-ArcGIS.md) -->

## If you already have _R_ and _RStudio_
Well... that's great! However, you need to check that your version is the same or close to the one we are using in the labs, which is 4.1.2. To check type

    > version

in the command console. If your version is very different then you may need to upgrade. You will probably be fine if you have a version that starts 4.1. If not unfortunately you'll have to _uninstall_ the existing version and then install a new version per the instructions on the page linked above.
