#### Geog 315 T2 2019 Week 4
# Making thematic maps in *R*
Last week you were introduced to *R* and to the `sf` and `tmap` packages for handling spatial data and simple map-making. This week we continue this exploration.

The instructions this week are in several parts, to make it a bit easier to cope.
+ [Introducing the data](lab-03-01-introducing-the-data.md)
+ [Selecting and tidying the data](lab-03-02-selecting-and-tidying-data.md)
+ [How to use the `tmap` functions](lab-03-03-using-tmap.md)
+ [The lab assignment](lab-03-04-assignment-instructions.md)

You may want to take a quick look at the last of these so you know what is expected of you, then come back to this document and work through the first three to learn the various tools you can use to accomplish what is asked of you.

**BUT BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING** load the libraries we'll be using:
```{r}
library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(dplyr)
```
