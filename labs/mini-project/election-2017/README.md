# Aotearoa New Zealand General Election 2017
These data are for the general election held in September 2017, and have been obtained from the Electoral Commission website, particularly [this page](https://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2017/statistics/index.html).

## Data
The specific election datasets are as follows

+ [Locations of polling places](voting-places-2017.gpkg?raw=true). These are direct from the Electoral Commission website, so any errors and omissions are per their data.
+ [General electorate boundaries](non-maori-electorates-2017.gpkg?raw=true) and [Māori electorate boundaries](maori-electorates-2017.gpkg?raw=true)
+ [General electorate party vote results](non-maori-electorate-detailed-party-results-2017.csv?raw=true) and [Māori electorate party vote results](non-maori-electorate-detailed-party-results-2017.csv?raw=true) detailed by polling places. These do not include special and postal votes (e.g. votes from serving military or others overseas).

In case you are interested, I assembled the detailed results from the electorate-by-electorate details, using [this python code](collate-election-2017.ipynb).
