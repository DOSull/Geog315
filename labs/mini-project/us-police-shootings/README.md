# US Police shootings 2015-20
These data were obtained from these [_Washington Post_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/) and [_Guardian_](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database) projects to record (to the extent possible) all police-involved shootings in the United States from 2015 onwards. Specifically the data were downloaded from [this site](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings).

## Data
Here's [the dataset](us-police-shootings-2015-20.gpkg?raw=true). There are more shootings in the original dataset (at the above link) but these are the 5114 that have been geocoded (i.e. placed on a map).

Information about what the various attributes of the data mean can be found at the above web-pages.
