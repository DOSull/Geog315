# Aotearoa placename origins
These data were sourced from the locations referenced at [this page](https://github.com/fogonwater/we-are-here/tree/master/8_heart_memory#801-ingoa-w%C4%81hi-o-aotearoa--place-names-of-new-zealand) describing how one of the maps in Chris McDowall and Tim Denee's [_We Are Here_](https://www.masseypress.ac.nz/books/all/all/we-are-here) was produced.

## Data
+ [Placenames of New Zealand](placenames.gpkg?raw=true)

An example map produced from these data is [shown here](https://github.com/TeHikuMedia/nga-kupu) (scroll down for the map).

The key columns in the data table are:

+ `reo` the number of elements in the name considered likely to be te reo
+ `maybe` the number of elements in the name consider possibly to be te reo
+ `other` the number of elements in the name considered not likely to be te reo

These results were assigned using the code available on [this repository](https://github.com/TeHikuMedia/nga-kupu).
