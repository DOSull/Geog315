# UFO sightings in the US
These data are shown in this [rather wonderful web map](https://metrocosm.com/ufo-sightings-map.html). You'll find that data themselves at [this link](https://metrocosm.com/sightings11.geojson) along with information about how they have been collected [here](http://metrocosm.com/map-of-ufo-sightings/). At the latter link you'll also find some analysis of patterns in the data, which could form a jumping off point for your own investigations.

## Other data
To explore the data with respect to general population patterns, you will need more general demographic and other data available [here](../README.md#us-datasets).
