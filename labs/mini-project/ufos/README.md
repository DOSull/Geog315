# UFO sightings in the US
These data are shown in this previously [rather wonderful web map](https://metrocosm.com/ufo-sightings-map.html). It's no longer as wonderful as it was because it looks like the basemap access token for Mapbox has expired (probably).

Anyway, you'll find the data themselves at [this link](https://metrocosm.com/sightings11.geojson) along with information about how they have been collected [here](http://metrocosm.com/map-of-ufo-sightings/). At the latter link you'll also find some analysis of patterns in the data, which could form a jumping off point for your own investigations.

## Other data
To explore the data with respect to general population patterns and avoid [this problem](https://xkcd.com/1138/) you will need more general demographic and other data available [here](../us-census-data.md).
