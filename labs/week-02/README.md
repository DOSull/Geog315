# Introducing *R* and *RStudio*
The data for this lab are in [this file](data.zip?raw=true). This is a *zip* file and must be unpacked into a folder you have access to on the machine you are using. If you are working on a lab machine, it needs to be a folder on the **H: drive**. If you are unsure how to do this, ask for help, as if you get it wrong, you will inevitably run into problems later in the session.

## Introduction
This lab will introduce you to the statistical analysis and programming environment *R*, running in *RStudio* (which makes it a bit easier to deal with). *R* has become one of the standard tools for statistical analysis particularly in the academic research community, but [increasingly also in commercial and other work settings](https://statfr.blogspot.com/2018/08/r-generation-story-of-statistical.html). *R* is well suited to these settings for a number of reasons, particularly

1. it is free [as in beer];
2. it is easily extensible; and
3. because of 1 and 2, many new methods of analysis first become available in *packages* contributed to the *R* ecosystem by researchers in the field.

The last point is why we are using *R* in this course. All required software is installed on the lab machines.

Like any good software, versions of *R* are available for MacOS, Windows and Linux so you can install a copy on your own computer and work on this lab in your own time&mdash;you don't need to be at the timetabled lab sections to complete the assignment, although you will find it helpful to attend to get assistance from the instructors, and also from one another.

To get up and running on your own computer, you will need to download and install *R* itself, and also, optionally, (**but HIGHLY recommended**) install *RStudio*. [Details of the installation](../week-01/README.md) were provided last week. If you are still having difficulties, just ask, and we'll do what we can to help. Installation is pretty straightforward on all platforms.

When you are running *R* you will want a web connection to install any additional packages called for in lab instructions. You will also find it useful to have a reasonably high resolution display (an old 1024&times;768 display will not be much fun to work on, but high pixel density modern displays, such as 4K, can be a bit painful also, without tweaking the display settings). For this reason alone, you may find it good to work on the lab machines.

### *DON'T PANIC!*
This lab introduces *R* by just asking you to get on with it, without stopping to explain too much, at least not at first. This is because it's probably better, to just do things with *R* to get a feel for what it's about without thinking too hard about what is going on; kind of like learning to swim by jumping in at the deep end. You may sometimes feel like you are drowning. Try not to worry too much and stick with it, and bear in mind that the assignments will not assume you are some kind of *R* guru.

Ask questions, confer with your fellow students, consult Google (this [cartoon](https://xkcd.com/627/) is good advice).
