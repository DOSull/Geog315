#### Geog 315 T2 2019 Week 5
# Spatial data wrangling in *R*
Last week you (hopefully) got accustomed to basic map-making using the `sf` and `tmap`. 

This week we focus more on typical kinds of data wrangling that are required *before* you can even think about making useful maps continue this exploration.

This time there are questions through the different sections so that you have a better idea when you should be paying close attention, and also so that it is easier to see where you can get credit for completing tasks and answering questions. I have also made the ability to answer the questions a bit less dependent on totally *getting* the details of the code.

You can look at the last page, to get an overview of the assignment requirements.

Again, the instructions this week are in several parts.
+ [Introducing the data](lab-04-01-introducing-the-data.md)
+ [Dealing with map projections](lab-04-02-map-projections.md)
+ [Spatial joins, summarising data, and throwing away spatial information](lab-04-03-spatial-joins.md)
+ [The assignment summarised](lab-04-05-assignment-summarised.md)
