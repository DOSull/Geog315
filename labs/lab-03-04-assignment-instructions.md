# The assignment
Your task is to make a map of the presidential election result contained in the supplied dataset.

In doing this, you need to consider the following issues:
+ Appropriate data to map. Probably none of the supplied attributes is quite what you need to make an effective map, so you will need to add one or more new attributes (this was explained [here](lab-03-02-selecting-and-tidying-data.md#adding-new-attributes))
+ Choose an appropriate map classification style, a sensible number of classes, and a meaningful colour scheme (there are explanations of how to do all these things [here](lab-03-03-using-tmap.md))
+ Add any additional map features that you think are useful such as a legend, north arrow, scale bar, overlay of state boundaries and so on

Below is an example map

There is plenty wrong with this map, so don't consider it something to aim for.

When you have made a map you are happy with, use the plot export feature in *RStudio* to export it to a PNG image file, and then include it in a Word document, including a short write up explaining the design choices you made to produce your map. There is no need to provide the *R* code you used&mdash;I am more interested in the design choices, not how they were accomplished.

Once you have finished your write up (it does not need to be very long) then export the Word document to a PDF file (make sure the document includes your map!) and save it to a filename that *includes your name*. Upload this PDF document to the dropbox provided on Blackboard by the end of the day on 9 August 2019.
