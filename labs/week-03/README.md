# Making thematic maps in *R*
We cover a lot of ground in this lab, including handling simple spatial data in *R*, and the options available for mapping using the `tmap` package. Keep in mind that you can refer back to last week's material if you need to refresh your memory of anything we did previously.

The instructions this week are in several parts, to make it a bit easier to follow.  

+ [Introducing the data](making-maps-in-R-01-introducing-the-data.md)
+ [Selecting and tidying the data](making-maps-in-R-02-selecting-and-tidying-data.md)
+ [How to use the `tmap` functions](making-maps-in-R-03-using-tmap.md)
+ [The lab assignment](making-maps-in-R-04-assignment.md)

You may want to take a quick look at the last of these so you know what is expected of you, then come back to this document and work through the first three to learn the various tools you can use to accomplish what is asked of you.

## Videos
Videos supporting each section are linked below. These use a different data set to demonstrate some of the ideas. You can download that dataset [here](ak-region-ethnicity.gpkg?raw=true), if you'd like to try following along. The video 'cuts' might overlap a little. The more important videos for completing the assignment are indicated by a ** symbol.
