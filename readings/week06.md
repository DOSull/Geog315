# Week 6 Raster data
Chapter 9 (pages 239-276) in my book (with Dave Unwin), _Geographic Information Analysis_, about 'Describing and Analyzing Fields' and the various possible representations of surfaces (of which raster is only one possibility), is available from the library at [this link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9780470549094).

## Raster and vector
Probably the 'go to' article on the 'raster-vector' debate in GIS is:

+ Couclelis H. 1992. [People manipulate objects (but cultivate fields): beyond the raster-vector debate in GIS](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-55966-3_3). In _Theories and Methods of Spatio-temporal Reasoning in Geographic Space_, 65â€“77. Berlin; Heidelberg: Springer.

I am less certain that the difference between raster and vector representations is as deeply grounded in philosophy than Helen Couclelis, but it is still an interesting and readable discussion of some of the issues.

Some additional food for thought is provided by this excellent (and excellently titled) paper:

+ Fisher P. 1997. [The pixel: A snare and a delusion](https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/014311697219015). _International Journal of Remote Sensing_ **18**(3): 679-685.

## Non-physical examples of raster surfaces:
+ Wood JD, PF Fisher, JA Dykes, DJ Unwin and K Stynes. 1999. [The Use of the Landscape Metaphor in Understanding Population Data](https://dx.doi.org/10.1068/b4122). _Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design_ **26**(2) 281-295. 
+ Stewart JQ. 1947. [Empirical mathematical rules concerning the distribution and equilibrium of population](https://www.jstor.org/stable/211132). _Geographical Review_ **37**(3) 461-485.

## Vector fields
[Cameron Beccario](https://github.com/cambecc)'s amazing visualization of global weather models,  _earth_ is available [here](http://earth.nullschool.net/). 

Unfortunately, the library does not have access to this old classic:

+ Tobler WR. 1987. Experiments In Migration Mapping By Computer. _The American Cartographer_ **14**(2) 155-163. DOI: 10.1559/152304087783875273

but if you are interested, I have a PDF and can share.

## Tools
I think the 'cheat sheet' provided this week is about as good as you'll find (I am biased, of course), but if you need other guides to using `terra`:

+ [Comprehensive documentation](https://rspatial.org/pkg/index.html) from its developer [Robert Hijmans](https://desp.ucdavis.edu/people/robert-j-hijmans).
+ The [raster materials in _Geocomputation with R_](https://r.geocompx.org/raster-vector.html)
