# Week 3 Colour and map design
## The grammar of graphics
+ Wickham H. 2010. [A Layered Grammar of Graphics](https://dx.doi.org/10.1198/jcgs.2009.07098 "Hadley Wickham's article about a layered grammar of graphics"). _Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics_ **19**(1) 3–28.

## Some resources on choropleth maps
+ [What to consider when creating choropleth maps](https://blog.datawrapper.de/choroplethmaps/ "choropleth map design considerations") by Lisa Charlotte Muth.
+ Tennekes M. 2018. [`tmap`: Thematic Maps in R](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v084i06 "The paper introducing tmap to the world"). _Journal of Statistical Software_ **84**(6).

## Data measurement scales
+ Stevens SS. 1946. [On the theory of scales of measurements](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1675368 "The original paper on scales of measurement - nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio"). _Science_ **103**: 677–680.
+ Velleman PF and L Wilkinson. 1993. [Nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio typologies are misleading](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2684788 "A more recent take, suggesting the scales are limited, even if useful."). _The American Statistician_ **47**(1): 65–72.
+ Chrisman NR. 1998. [Rethinking levels of measurement for cartography](https://dx.doi.org/10.1559/152304098782383043 "An approach more related to cartographic questions."). _Cartography and Geographic Information Systems_ **25**(4): 231–242.

## Colour
+ The [ColorBrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org "ColorBrewer website") website is a nice way to get familiar with different colour palettes
+ This [colour blindness simulator](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/ "colour blindness simulator") is really useful for getting an idea of how your maps will look with various kinds of colour blindness
+ This [video about the viridis colour palette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAoljeRJ3lU "viridis colour palette presentation") project is a great primer about how incredibly complicated colour is

and if you think that's complicated, then here's how complicated it gets when you take colour blindness seriously (which we really should):
