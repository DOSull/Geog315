## Communications
The primary mode of communication for course announcements will be via Blackboard, so please ensure that your contact details there are up to date and are regularly checked (note that Blackboard defaults to your myvuw email address).

Blackboard is also where you will find lecture video recordings, assignment dropboxes and information about your grades.

**_Check in regularly on Blackboard!_**

All other course information (links to lecture slides, lab materials, additional video content) will be posted to this website.

## Class representatives
Class representatives provide a way to communicate feedback to the teaching staff during the course. Class representatives will be selected in the first week or two of class, and details of how to contact them will be provided as soon as they are available. Anyone interested in taking on this role, just let me know, so we can resolve any competition! Once we've agreed who is doing it, they can [sign up here](https://www.vuwsa.org.nz/class-representatives).
