```{r remedy001}
library(dplyr)
```

Make a couple of simple data frames

```{r remedy002}
df1 <- data.frame(id = 1:4, 
                  x = c("one", "two", "three", "four"))
df2 <- data.frame(id = 3:6, 
                  y = as.character(3:6))
```

Now check them out

```{r remedy003}
as_tibble(df1)
as_tibble(df2)
```

## Various joins

`inner_join` only retains the matching cases.

```{r remedy004}
inner_join(df1, df2)
```

`left_join` retains all records from the first table, regardless of whether there is a matching record in the second.

```{r remedy004}
left_join(df1, df2)
```

`right_join` is the opposite - all rows in the second table are retained whether or not there is a match.

```{r remedy006}
right_join(df1, df2)
```

Finally (not really there are a couple of other obscurities...), `full_join` retains all records across both tables regardless of matches.

```{r remedy007}
full_join(df1, df2)
```
