## Important times
**Lectures** are in **AM 105** from **1:10-2:00 Tuesdays** and **Fridays**.

**Labs** are in **KK 216** from **11:00-1:00** on **Thursdays**.

## Delivery
This class is offered face-to-face for both lectures and labs. Lectures will be recorded and available on Blackboard soon after.

Software required to complete lab sessions is free to download and install so that you can complete labs while working remotely. Details of getting set up for this will be available in the first week of semester.

Supplemental video tutorial material will be provided to assist students in completion of labs remotely.

In addition a [course Slack channel](https://vuwgeog315t22021.slack.com/ "Course slack channel") (an invitation to joing will be sent out early in semester) provides rapid responses to technical questions about lab materials (please use it, and also answer other's questions if you can!).

If you have particular difficulties with labs and are working remotely then appointments to meet by Zoom can be made from [this link](https://calendly.com/dosullivan "Schedule an office hours appointment").

## Communications
The primary mode of communication for course announcements will be via Blackboard, so please ensure that your contact details there are up to date and are regularly checked (note that Blackboard defaults to your myvuw email address).

Blackboard is also where you will find lecture video recordings, assignment dropboxes and information about your grades. What I am saying is: **check in regularly on Blackboard!**

All other course information (links to lecture slides, lab materials, additional video content) will be posted to this website, where you will find the [schedule](schedule.md) and [labs](labs.md) areas particularly useful.
