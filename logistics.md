## Important times
**Lectures** are in **AM 105** from **12:00-12:50 Mondays** and in **Murphy 102** from **12:00-12:50 Wednesdays**.

**Labs** are in **KK 216** from **2:10-4:00** on **Wednesdays**.

## Delivery
This class is offered face-to-face for both lectures and labs. Lectures will be recorded and available on Blackboard soon after.

Software required to complete lab sessions is free to download and install so that you can complete labs while working remotely. Details of getting set up for this will be available in the first week of semester.

Supplemental video tutorial material will be provided to assist students in completion of labs remotely.

In addition a [course Slack channel](https://vuwgeog315t12022.slack.com/ "Course slack channel") (an invitation to joing will be sent out early in semester) provides rapid responses to technical questions about lab materials (please use it, and also answer other's questions if you can!).

If you have particular difficulties with labs and are working remotely then appointments to meet by Zoom can be made from [this link](https://calendly.com/dosullivan "Schedule an office hours appointment").

## Communications
### Blackboard
The primary mode of communication for course announcements will be [Blackboard](https://blackboard.vuw.ac.nz "VUW Blackboard"), so please ensure that your contact details there are up to date and are regularly checked (note that Blackboard defaults to your myvuw email address). Blackboard is also where you will find lecture video recordings, assignment dropboxes for submission of assignments and information about your grades. What I am saying is: **check in regularly on Blackboard!**

### This website
All other course information (links to lecture slides, lab materials, additional video content) will be posted to this website (the one you are looking at right now) at [dosull.github.io/Geog315](https://dosull.github.io/Geog315). You will likely find the [schedule](schedule.md "Course chedule") and [labs](labs.md "Lab materials") areas particularly useful.

### Slack channel
A link to join the [course slack channel](https://vuwgeog315t12022.slack.com/ "Course slack channel") will be sent via Blackboard. This should be used for technical support questions on the labs, and is by the far quickest way to get help if you are stuck.

### Class representatives
Class representatives provide a way to communicate feedback to the teaching staff during the course. Class representatives will be selected in the first week or two of class, and details of how to contact them will be provided as soon as they are available. Anyone interested in taking on this role, let me know, so we can resolve any competition! Once we've agreed who is doing it, they can [sign up here](https://www.vuwsa.org.nz/class-representatives "VUWSA class representatives signup").

### Māori advisor (kaiakiaki) for Science and Health
[Paora Douglas](mailto:paora.douglas@vuw.ac.nz "email Paora") is available to support tauri Māori studying in sciences and health.
