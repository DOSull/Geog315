# COVID alert level changes
If COVID alert levels change, the class will continue uninterrrupted, as detailed in the sections below. The golden rule at all levels is **stay home if you feel unwell**.

## Level 1
Class as normal. Attendance in person _much_(!) preferred. Lectures will be recorded and available at the link posted on [Blackboard](https://blackboard.vuw.ac.nz/webapps/blackboard/execute/launcher?type=Course&id=_111517_1&url= "Course Blackboard link"), but there *will be no livestream*.

## Level 2
This is the complicated one, which requires the most care and attention.

*Class will continue in-person*, but at reduced room capacity, so you may decide to stay home and catch up with the recording later. Depending on how long level 2 is in place, we may make provisions for a livestream of the lecture with details posted on [Blackboard](https://blackboard.vuw.ac.nz/webapps/blackboard/execute/launcher?type=Course&id=_111517_1&url= "Course Blackboard link"). Room entry *must* be recorded using the COVID app and/or the sign-in sheet.

*In the labs*, you must record entry using the COVID app and/or sign in sheet. Sanitise hands on entry and exit from labs. Wipe down your workstation (keyboard, mouse) with wipes provided at start and end of session.

You do not need to wear a mask, but I strongly recommend that you consider it since lab sessions often involve close proximity where it is difficult to remain in compliance with physical distance recommendations.

## Levels 3 and 4
Class and labs will be solely over zoom (links will be posted on [Blackboard](https://blackboard.vuw.ac.nz/webapps/blackboard/execute/launcher?type=Course&id=_111517_1&url= "Course Blackboard link")) with recordings available later for review.
