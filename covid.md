# COVID provisions
As the COVID situation develops, the aim is that class will continue uninterrrupted, as detailed below. The golden rule regardless (and this applies to any illness, not just COVID) is: **stay home if you feel unwell**.

## General comments
Class will continue to run face to face. Attendance in person is preferred. Lectures will be recorded and available at the links posted on [Blackboard](https://blackboard.vuw.ac.nz "VUW Blackboard"), but there *will be no livestream* of the lectures.

If for whatever reason the lecturer is unable to be in the classroom, lectures will be given over Zoom (on a link that will be provided) and recorded.

Students should wear masks in all public spaces including teaching spaces, at all times. From the university guidance on the red traffic light setting:

"Students need to wear a mask at all times while indoors in public spaces on campus, including learning and teaching spaces (with the exception of the Library if they are able to maintain a 2m distance from others. Even in this latter situation, students will still be encouraged to keep their masks on)."

I am informed that spare masks will be available if you haven't got one, although I am unsure what the arrangements are for this.

## In the labs
You must record entry using the COVID app and/or sign in sheet. Sanitise hands on entry and exit from labs. Wipe down your workstation (keyboard, mouse) with wipes provided at start and end of session.

Per the note above, you should wear a mask. Lab sessions involve close proximity over an extended period where it is difficult to remain in compliance with physical distancing recommendations.

A livestream will run in the lab sessions, but students in the lab will be prioritised for assistance. If lab attendance in person is low, then we will switch to livestream only for the lab sessions, as this is the best way to give equal attention and support to all students. If this happens, you would be able to attend the lab to use university computers in KK216 but will need to login to the livestream from there to get assistance.
