# COVID or other illness provisions
As the COVID situation continues, in however reduced a form, the aim is for class to continue uninterrrupted, as detailed below. The golden rule regardless (and this applies to any illness, not just COVID) is: **stay home if you feel unwell**.

## General comments
Class will run face to face. Attendance in person is _strongly_ preferred and experience has shown that it leads to better learning outcomes also! Lectures will be recorded and available at the links posted on [Nuku](https://nuku.wgtn.ac.nz/courses/11944 "Course nuku page"), but there *will be no livestream* of the lectures unless we have moved to zoom. This is because the course sessions will not be formal lectures.

If for whatever reason the lecturer is unable to be in the classroom, lectures will be given over Zoom (on a link that will be provided), recorded, and posted on the course website soon after.
