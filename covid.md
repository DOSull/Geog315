# COVID provisions
As the COVID situation develops, the aim is that class will continue uninterrrupted, as detailed below. The golden rule regardless (and this applies to any illness, not just COVID) is: **stay home if you feel unwell**.

## General comments
Class will run face to face. Attendance in person is _much_(!) preferred. Lectures will be recorded and available at the links posted on [Blackboard](https://blackboard.vuw.ac.nz "VUW Blackboard"), but there *will be no livestream* of the lectures.

If for whatever reason the lecturer is unable to be in the classroom, lectures will be given over Zoom (on a link that will be provided) and recorded.

## In the labs
You must record entry using the COVID app and/or sign in sheet. Sanitise hands on entry and exit from labs. Wipe down your workstation (keyboard, mouse) with wipes provided at start and end of session.

You should also wear a mask. Lab sessions involve close proximity over an extended period where it is difficult to remain in compliance with physical distancing recommendations.
