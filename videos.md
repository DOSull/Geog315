# Videos
This page provides a 'one-stop shop' for the additional video material for the course. Note that these are a mixture of external resources, and videos I have recorded, dating from as early as 2020, so example datasets may not match this year's materials in all cases.

In person lecture recordings are on [Blackboard](https://blackboard.vuw.ac.nz "VUW Blackboard").

## Week 1
### Installing _R_ and _RStudio_

Videos supporting each section are linked below. These use a different data set to demonstrate some of the ideas. You can download that dataset [here](/labs/week-03/ak-region-ethnicity.gpkg?raw=true), if you'd like to try following along. Video 'cuts' might overlap a little.
