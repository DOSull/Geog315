# Project topics
The list of project topics and datasets is still being compiled and finalised for 2019. The list below is based on the list for 2018 (and is unlikely to change much). It is provided for general guidance.

Projects flagged with an \* are likely to require a bit more statistical ability than others.

## A. Social/human geography
### A1. Election patterns\*
Explore and report on patterns in the election results. You are also expected to investigate relationships with at least one other dataset (e.g. census data). For example, you may wish to determine the socio-demographic makeup of areas that were National supporters in the last election. Election data for the most recent election and for 2007 is available, as are the census datasets for 2013 and 2006.

### A2. Access to gambling outlets
Explore and report on patterns of access to gambling outlets. You are expected to use network analysis to calculate access. You may also wish to compare this access to census variables such as the deprivation index. For example, there may be a relationship between social deprivation and access to gambling. You may also explore changes over time (using 2006 and 2013 census and equivalent 2006 and 2013 gambling
locations).

### A3. House prices and accessibility to amenities\*
Using property sales reports, create a surface of house prices throughout Wellington City. Assess to what extent accessibility to green spaces and other amenities affect house prices in the city.

### A4. Evacuation Plan for Wellington
Using the Wellington City Council DEM, create an appropriate evacuation plan for Wellington City in the event of a Tsunami of 35m. This will require consideration of population, road networks and community facilities. Compare this evacuation plan with any currently available plans for Wellington.

### A5. Age Care accessibility
The New Zealand population is ageing&mdash;there are some concerns that the current age care facilities will not adequately meet future need. This project follows [Jacob Daube’s MSc methodology](http://researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz/handle/10063/3668). The road data will need significant cleaning and other datasets will require sourcing.

## B. Physical geography/earth science
### B1. Hydrological surfaces
Using the Lidar data for the Kapiti Coast, create a DEM. Using the DEM, create a river network. You will need to assess the quality of the DEM for use in this way. You should also assess the output river dataset against existing stream or river networks.

### B2. Landslide susceptibility\*
Using the Taranki Landslide dataset, determine the effect of different causal factors on landslide susceptibility in the area. Using this information, you should also create a landslide susceptibility/risk map. You may wish to calculate the landslide volume and other descriptive characteristics.

### B3. Stream Power
Using imagery, produce a measure of stream power for the Greater Wellington Region (GWR). Stream power is calculated using measures of stream length against stream width. Using the DEM, create a stream network for the GWR&mdash;you may need to choose a smaller study area within the GWR for proof of concept. Amend the network using aerial imagery and/or satellite imagery such as Kiwimage or Landsat to measure
stream length and width. You may also wish to assess the impact of vegetation or aspect.

### B4. Glacial Lake Growth
Glaciers that form proglacial lakes can rapidly lose mass through the process of ice berg calving. In the central Southern Alps seven prominent glaciers have formed lakes in recent decades. This project aims to  determine the progression of lake growth in this region using LandSat archive data. This project will include image classification of archive Landsat imagery and experimenting with both supervised and unsupervised classification techniques.

### B5. Antarctica\*
Climate model simulations have been performed for a range of global warming scenarios. In this project you will use the ensemble mean data, spanning 1850-2100 AD, for the warmest (RCP 8.5) scenario. The data are global, but you will need to extract just the region covering Antarctica and its surrounding ocean. First, use
the data to identify and quantify spatial variability across the continent for air temperature, precipitation, and sea-surface temperatures. Where do the biggest changes occur for each of these variables? Are they the same areas for each variable? Plot maps of the average rate-of-change for the period 1850 to 1950, and for the period 2000 to 2100. Describe what they show.  above you should be able to make some interpretations about how the Antarctic climate (including the ocean) might change by 2100 AD. The next step is to see how these changes correlate with areas of the ice sheet that are fast or slow flowing. Using the supplied surface velocity data, use spatial correlation analysis to assess whether there is any statistical relationship between your surface warming maps and the speed of ice sheet flow. If so, where are the strongest correlations, and which variable or variables are most strongly linked to flow speed? If there are no statistically significant correlations, why might this be?

## C. Environment/biogeography
### C1. The potential distribution of an invasive species\*
Determine, using the current dataset of Tradescantia Flumensis, the potential distribution of this invasive species. The LENZ layers provide a range of possible important environmental variables but other data sources (see list) may also be used. You will also need to create your own solar radiation layer for Wellington city and compare this against the layer in LENZ. You will need to comment on the implications of the accuracy of this comparison for the use of the other LENZ layers in distribution modelling.

### C2. Great Kererū Count 2015
The Great Kererū Count 2014 (the GKC) is a citizen science project organised by Kiwi Conservation Club and Kererū Discovery. Based on the data from 2015, identify patterns in the dataset that take the crowdsourced nature of the data collection into account, e.g. sightings are most likely near roads. You will  to identify relevant datasets to use to compare the GKC data against. This is a country wide citizen science project, you may wish to limit your initial analysis to Wellington and then identify the appropriate methodology before the analysis is run for the whole country.

### C3. Mouse Abundance at Zealandia\*
Zealandia want to assess the changes in mouse abundance over time and the effectiveness of their mouse control. Using Zealandia's records of mouse abundance, create a measure of mouse abundance, identify hot and cold spots and assess the role of influencing factors on the mouse distribution. You will want to consider
some or all of the following variables; gradient, aspect, distance to control locations, canopy height, and distance to fence. To assess the effectiveness of the control lines, please assess whether the habitats covered by the control lines are representative of the sanctuary.
