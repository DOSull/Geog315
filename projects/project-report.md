# The project report
This section provides some guidance on the project report, which is the major assessment item associated with the project.

**First thing to note**: this is an _individually written and assessed piece of work_. It is understood that you will include maps, data etc. that reflect the collective efforts of your group,but the final report should be your own work, reflecting not only what the group did, but emphasizing your individual contribution to the group, and also your individual interpretation of results, ideas for further work, etc.

That said, on to the major features.

**Word count**: 1500-2000 words not including references, and not including things like data tables or figures (pictures are not worth 1000 words in this context!)

## Sample organization of a report
There is no need to follow this exactly

### 1. Introduction (150-200 words)
The overall topic of the project, with its major goals and an indication of findings

### 2. Review of the topic (300-400 words)
Any background materials from the literature, previous reports, examples of best practice you came across in researching the topic and which influenced how you decided to proceed and (especially) why.

### 3. Data sources and data processing(300-400 words)
Where you sourced data and general outline of processing required to make them useable for the work carried out. This should not be a blow-by-blow account of which ArcGIS toolbox or other piece of software was used. It should be more about (for example) what attributes were in the datasets procured that you got rid of, what reorganization of spatial data types were needed (polygons made into points, rasters into vectors, line layers into network datasets, etc), and also any derived attributes that you had to create to enable analysis to proceed (e.g., pseudo absence points, areas of landslides, inferred building heights, etc.)

### 4. Processing carried out (300-400 words)
Again not blow-by-blow account of every single step, but an overall description of the workflow, highlighting key steps, major challenges and how these were overcome.

### 5. Results and discussion thereof (300-400 words)
Present results in the form of maps, tables, charts, etc., and discuss their significance and implications.

### 6. Conclusions (150-200 words)
Here you should consider:

(i) limitations of the results arising from data problems, questionable assumptions, problems with the tools, etc.,
(ii) suggestions for future work (what would you do if you were continuing the work as&mdash;say&mdash;a Master thesis, with a whole year to work on it?

### 7. References (not included in word count)
A list of resources, articles, reports, etc. used in the work. Don't include ESRI or other software online help, do include research articles, government reports, and if online resources helped with solving particular problems, links to websites. I am unconcerned about the reference formatting, but should be able to easily find anything you do cite. Please cite from within the text when a particular reference is specific to a particular claim you make in the report, i.e., don't just provide a list of resources used with no links from the main text.

### Finally... 8. (OPTIONAL)
You may also include reflections on how the group worked together (or not). \[does not count to word limit\]

This is your chance to explain any problems that arose with the group that you think are relevant to assessment of the work. Preferably, you should raise any such issues with me ahead of the written report submission, but this is another way to raise concerns. Of course, I am also happy to hear about success stories!

## Notes
1. The section outline above is for guidance only, but indicates the general coverage required. You are likely to include figures (maps, tables, charts) in sections 3, 4, 5, and perhaps also 2 and 6.
2. Reports will be put through Turnitin to check for originality.
3. Including images in your report you will generally find the PNG format to be better for map and graph outputs than JPEG. JPEG is fine for photographs and not much else. If your maps looks 'grainy' it's probably because you are using JPEGs.
4. In maps, please take the time to include legends (and also take the time to edit any number ranges shown on legends to sensible values, i.e., not for example Arc's default preference for 23.457295 - 37.12398508 or whatever, change that to 23.5 - 37.1). I should warn you that this is something I get annoyed by in maps (it indicates a lack of care in the design) and I will almost certainly penalize it in marking.
5. Also on maps... check with lab demonstrators that you are using a sensible projection for the work you are doing. In most case this will mean New Zealand Map Grid (EPSG 2193). Early in the process is the time to sort this out, not in the last day.

## Finally finally
There is no rubric for the assessment, which will be based on an overall evaluation of the quality of the report itself and of the thinking and work that underpins it (i.e. the project itself). However, the above outline gives a good sense of the overall coverage expected.
