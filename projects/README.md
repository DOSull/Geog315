## General description and goals
The project you undertake should tell a cohesive story and be clear about what you are aiming to accomplish before you set out.

This is a GIS project, so you are graded on how well you understood and can explain what you  done, whether you  the correct tools and your understanding of the data. You will also be  on whether the conclusions you draw are appropriate for the data and tools you used.

Again as this is a GIS project, you should not spend too much of your time doing repetitive tasks. If you find that you are spending hours and hours cleaning data in Excel, or hand digitising locations, then think again! Talk to the instructors about ways to make these tasks easier, and your project more productive, by automating such processes. We are covering some of the tasks involved in lab assignments using *R* and there are many tools to assist in automating the really boring stuff! Doing so shows initiative, and is also a skill you can be graded on. You should aim to extend your analysis rather than do a lot of data collection, data cleaning by hand and/or digitising.

Your group will need to determine the exact research questions you are aiming top address and choose the appropriate methodology to complete ton answer them.
